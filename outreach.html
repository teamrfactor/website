								most of them had no experience with robotics. After with talking about the competitions we even gave them a small tutorial on LEGO&reg; Mindstorms. Due to the heavy student requests, we also demoed our FRC 2017 robot as well as the RoboSoccer
								robot made by Hitansh, Jai and Tanay. During the presentation many students asked questions and were keenly interested to learn much more.
